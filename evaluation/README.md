Evaluation
==========

Unfortunately, due to licensing issues primarily regarding RCV1 and RCV2 
we are unable to include the evaluation pipeline used for the corpus 
that was introduced by Klementiev et al. (2012).
To reproduce our exeriments it is necessary to compile the crosslingual
document classification corpus from the list of documents supplied 
by Klementiev et al.
